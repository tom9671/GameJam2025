  - dialogue: I have been researching the marine life of the Abyssopelagic Zone for
      nearly thirteen years.

      responsible for the discovery of oceanic life previously unknown to mankind.

      more humiliating.

  - dialogue: "Because of prior \u2026 incidents the university was unwilling to
      fund another expedition to the Cator Ocean. However, proper analysis of the
      sea life here proves essential to my research."
    characterName: Dr. Shelley
    displayImage: {fileID: 0}
  - dialogue: "I was only able to gather enough money to procure this rather \u2026
      unremarkable submarine. Captain James is competent enough, but I\u2019m not
      used to working without a research team."
    characterName: Dr. Shelley
    displayImage: {fileID: 0}
  - dialogue: "If this expedition wasn\u2019t having enough setbacks, there\u2019s
      not as much sea life as I anticipated. We\u2019ve been down here for about
      four days and I have only managed to gather three samples. I spent weeks studying
      maps and migration patterns and am positive that this is the best location
      to collect data."

  - dialogue: It must be that horrible engine. It seems to grow louder and more irritating
      everyday. I wonder if the Captain can do anything about it.
    characterName: Dr. Shelley
    displayImage: {fileID: 0}
  - dialogue: "Ah! Dr. Shelley, How are you? It\u2019s good to see your face, you
      ought to come out of that lab every once in a while. Have you found any more
      samples?"
    characterName: Captain
    displayImage: {fileID: 0}
  - dialogue: "Actually, that is what I was hoping to discuss with you. I wonder
      if my difficulty finding suitable samples is due to how loud our engine is.
      I was thinking you could go down to the engine room and see if there\u2019s
      anything you could do."
    characterName: Dr. Shelley
    displayImage: {fileID: 0}
  - dialogue: "Well, some engine noise is pretty standard on a ship this old. I\u2019ve
      been captain of this very boat for almost 34 years now. Angie may be a bit
      noisy, but she\u2019s reliable where it counts."
    characterName: Captain
    displayImage: {fileID: 0}
  - dialogue: "Age aside,  the marine life I\u2019m supposed to analyze here are
      of the utmost importance and \u2026 Angie\u2019s \u2026  engine is scaring
      my samples away and I would really appreciate it if you could go down there
      and see if there\u2019s anything you could do to make the engine quieter."
    characterName: Dr. Shelley
    displayImage: {fileID: 0}
  - dialogue: "Well, no promises, but I\u2019ll go down and see if there's anything
      I can do. Wait here. Make sure we don\u2019t steer right into a shark"
