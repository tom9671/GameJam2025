  - characterName: Dr. Shelley
    dialogue: "Because of prior \u2026 incidents the university was unwilling to
      fund another expedition to the Cator Ocean. However, proper analysis of the
      sea life here proves essential to my research."

    dialogue: "I was only able to gather enough money to procure this rather \u2026
      unremarkable submarine. Captain James is competent enough, but I\u2019m not
      used to working without a research team."

    dialogue: "If this expedition wasn\u2019t having enough setbacks, there\u2019s
      not as much sea life as I anticipated. We\u2019ve been down here for about
      four days and I have only managed to gather three samples. I spent weeks studying
      maps and migration patterns and am positive that this is the best location
      to collect data."

    dialogue: "Ah! Dr. Shelley, How are you? It\u2019s good to see your face, you
      ought to come out of that lab every once in a while. Have you found any more
      samples?"

    displayImage: {fileID: 0}
  - characterName: Dr. Shelley
    dialogue: "Actually, that is what I was hoping to discuss with you. I wonder
      if my difficulty finding suitable samples is due to how loud our engine is.
      I was thinking you could go down to the engine room and see if there\u2019s
      anything you could do."

      been captain of this very boat for almost 34 years now. Angie may be a bit
      noisy, but she\u2019s reliable where it counts."

      of the utmost importance and \u2026 Angie\u2019s \u2026  engine is scaring
      my samples away and I would really appreciate it if you could go down there
      and see if there\u2019s anything you could do to make the engine quieter."
